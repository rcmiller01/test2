# üìñ Unified AI Companion - User Guide

## Welcome to Your Unified AI Companion

Your AI companion is a single, adaptive intelligence that grows with you. Unlike traditional chatbots with fixed personalities, your companion starts neutral and develops its approach based on your needs, preferences, and the context of your conversations.
