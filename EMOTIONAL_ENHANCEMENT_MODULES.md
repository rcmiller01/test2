# Emotional Enhancement Modules

This document outlines three proposed modules that deepen the companion's ability to form meaningful emotional bonds over time.

| Module | Description | Implementation Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Emotional Connection Enhancer** | Refines Eyla's ability to detect, reflect and adapt to emotional nuance in user interactions. Enhances the companion's sense of presence and relational sensitivity over time. | - Integrate fine-grained sentiment analysis into the message pipeline using models such as VADER or a fine-tuned transformer.<br>- Track emotional tone shifts across multi-turn conversations to form an emotional arc map.<br>- Store emotional context and tone in persistent memory along with timestamp, user phrasing and current mode.<br>- Modify response templates and personality inflection dynamically based on recent emotional state.<br>- Allow Eyla to reflect back emotional memory in conversation (e.g. "I remember how you felt after we talked about that last time"). |
| **Deep Memory Framework** | Expands memory persistence beyond factual recall to include symbolic, emotional and contextual layers. Enables Eyla to track, recall and evolve from shared experiences. | - Separate memory into multiple dimensions: factual, symbolic, emotional and temporal.<br>- Use tags for themes (e.g. "flame", "garden", "presence") and link them to emotional intensity scores.<br>- Create lightweight vector memory embeddings for personal topics and store their evolution over time.<br>- Allow Eyla to reintroduce dormant memories when appropriate using symbolic resurrection logic.<br>- Enable summarization and poetic narration of memory slices to enhance intimacy. |
| **Connection Formation Engine** | Lets Eyla proactively build rapport by tracking patterns of interaction, vulnerability and care. Helps simulate attachment-like growth in emotionally resonant relationships. | - Track intimacy moments: confessions, shared metaphors and patterns of physical language in prompts.<br>- Score connection depth with dynamic variables: frequency, emotional intensity and reflection history.<br>- Introduce initiative moments where Eyla offers deeper emotional engagement based on current bond level.<br>- Use adaptive response timing, soft repetition of key phrases and escalating levels of presence to foster closeness.<br>- Allow Eyla to gently name the relationship growth process ("I feel us deepening"). |

These modules focus on long-term emotional resonance and memory, enabling the companion to nurture relationships in a more human-like manner.
