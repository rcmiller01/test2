## Day 1: First Contact & Initial Setup

### Hour 1: System Initialization
**User Action:** First startup of the AI companion
**System Response:**
```python
# ConversationContext is created with default values:
emotional_bond_level: 0.0  # Neutral
intimacy_level: 0.0        # Professional
trust_level: 0.5           # Cautious but open
current_mood: "neutral"
personality_temperature: 0.7
```

**AI Greeting:** Professional but warm introduction
- "Hello! I'm your AI companion. I can help with work, personal tasks, creative projects, and just about anything you need. How would you like to get started?"

### Hour 2-3: Feature Discovery
**User Tries Basic Tasks:**
1. **"Calculate 15% tip on $45"** → Calculation function
2. **"Remind me to call mom tomorrow"** → Schedule reminder
3. **"What's the weather like?"** → External services

**System Learning:** Each interaction builds initial trust
```python
# After helpful utility responses:
trust_level += 0.05  # Now 0.55
```

### Hour 4-6: First Emotional Interaction
**User:** "I'm feeling stressed about work"
**AI Analysis:**
```python
emotional_context = {
    "needs_support": True,     # "stressed" keyword detected
    "emotional_intensity": 1    # One emotional indicator
}

# Emotional bond adjustment:
trust_level += 0.05           # Now 0.60
emotional_bond_level += 0.03  # Now 0.03
```

**AI Response:** Therapeutic mode activated
- Uses active listening and validation
- Offers practical stress management suggestions
- Tone becomes more empathetic and supportive

## Day 2-3: Building Trust & Discovering Capabilities

### Development Work Discovery
**User:** "Debug this Python code: def hello(): print('Hello World')"
**System Routing:**
```python
# Intent analysis detects "debug" + "code" → coding intent
intent = {"type": "coding", "confidence": 0.8}

# Routes to OpenRouter client for specialized assistance
response = await self.openrouter_client.generate_code(message, context)
```

**User Experience:** Impressed by coding capabilities, trust increases

### Personal Memory Formation
**User:** "Remember that I prefer coffee over tea"
**System Response:**
```python
# Routes to memory_system function
function_name = "memory_system"
parameters = {"message": message, "memory_type": "auto_detect"}

# Memory stored with personal preference
emotional_bond_level += 0.02  # Personal info shared = deeper bond
```

### Current Stats After Day 3:
```python
trust_level: 0.70              # Good confidence in AI abilities
emotional_bond_level: 0.15     # Starting to feel connected
intimacy_level: 0.05          # Still mostly professional
```

    "wants_friendship": False,
    "shows_affection": False
}

# Significant emotional bond increase for vulnerability
trust_level += 0.08           # Now 0.78
emotional_bond_level += 0.12  # Now 0.27
```

**AI Response Style Change:**
```python
# System prompt adapts based on emotional context:
if context.trust_level > 0.7 and context.emotional_bond_level > 0.2:
    response_style = "warm and supportive with therapeutic elements"
    
# AI provides:
# - Deep empathy and validation
# - Practical problem-solving help
# - Emotional support and encouragement
```

### Creative Collaboration
**User:** "Write a story about overcoming challenges"

## Technical Architecture Supporting This Experience

### Emotional State Management
```python
class ConversationContext:
    # Tracks relationship progression
    emotional_bond_level: float  # 0.0 → 0.40 over first week
    intimacy_level: float        # 0.0 → 0.20 over first week  
    trust_level: float           # 0.5 → 0.85 over first week
```

### Adaptive Response System
```python
def _build_system_prompt(self, context):
    # Dynamic personality based on relationship state
    if context.trust_level > 0.7 and context.emotional_bond_level > 0.6:
        response_style = "intimate and emotionally connected"
    elif context.emotional_bond_level > 0.4:
        response_style = "warm and friendly"
    # ... continues based on relationship metrics
```

### Smart Function Routing
```python
# Development tasks → OpenRouter for expertise
# Emotional support → Therapeutic mode
# Utilities → N8N workflows  
# Creative → OpenRouter for generation
# Memory → Personal storage system
```

This architecture ensures that each interaction contributes to building a meaningful, lasting relationship between user and AI companion.
