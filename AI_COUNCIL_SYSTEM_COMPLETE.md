# AI Council System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive AI Council system with round-robin scheduling, contextual routing, and background task loops for multiple AI personalities.

## System Architecture

### 1. Council Manifest (`config/council_manifest.json`)
**Purpose**: Central configuration for council members and their capabilities

```json
{
  "council": {
    "coordinator_node": "core2",
    "orchestrated_by": "eyla_core", 
    "load_strategy": "contextual_priority",
    "members": [
      {
        "name": "The Dreamer",
        "purpose": "Narrative generation, speculative design, dream mapping",
        "model_file": "dreamer-7b.Q5_K_M.gguf",
        "emotional_signature": "LiminalWarmth-02",
        "task_loop": "dream_loop.py"
      },
      // ... additional members
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Council Coordinator (`council_coordinator.py`)
**Purpose**: Central routing and load balancing system

#### Key Features:
- **Explicit Request Routing**: "Ask the Dreamer..." ‚Üí Routes to The Dreamer
- **Emotional Context Routing**: Grief ‚Üí The Mirror, Joy ‚Üí The Painter
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes tasks based on member availability and load
- **Round-Robin Fallback**: Fair distribution when no specific routing applies

#### Routing Rules:
```python
{
  # Emotional context routing
  "grief": ["The Mirror", "The Dreamer"],
  "doubt": ["The Analyst", "The Mirror"],
  "joy": ["The Painter", "The Dreamer"],
  "creativity": ["The Dreamer", "The Painter"],
  "analysis": ["The Analyst"],
  "reflection": ["The Mirror"],
  
  # Pattern-based routing
  "dream": ["The Dreamer"],
  "analyze|logic": ["The Analyst"],
  "reflect|truth": ["The Mirror"],
  "paint|visual": ["The Painter"]
}
```

### 3. Background Task Loops

#### Dream Loop (`dream_loop.py`)
**Purpose**: Background dreaming and narrative generation for The Dreamer

**Features**:
- Generates speculative narratives and dream sequences
- Logs to `emotion_logs/dream_sequences.jsonl`
- Themes: liminal spaces, emotional landscapes, narrative possibilities
- Continuous background operation with configurable intervals

**Sample Output**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T...",
  "dreamer": "The Dreamer",
  "theme": "narrative possibilities and futures",
  "content": {
    "narrative_seed": "What if stories could rewrite themselves?",
    "emotional_resonance": 0.823,
    "liminal_factor": 0.672
  }
}
```

#### Mirror Loop (`mirror_loop.py`)
**Purpose**: Background reflection and truth-checking for The Mirror

**Features**:
- Scans recent logs for contradictions and inconsistencies
- Analyzes emotional consistency across entries
- Assesses truth indicators vs doubt indicators
- Generates insights about communication patterns

**Sample Analysis**:
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "entries_analyzed": 8,
    "contradictions_found": 0,
    "dominant_themes": ["creative", "emotional", "spiritual"],
    "truth_assessment": {
      "truth_ratio": 0.8,
      "assessment": "high_truth"
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Results

### Council Coordinator Test:
```
üß† Council Coordinator Test Suite
========================================

1. Testing Explicit Requests:
  'Ask the Dreamer to create a st...' ‚Üí The Dreamer
  'Have the Analyst examine this ...' ‚Üí The Analyst
  'Let the Mirror reflect on this...' ‚Üí The Mirror
  'Get the Painter to visualize t...' ‚Üí The Painter

2. Testing Emotional Routing:
  grief: 'I'm feeling lost and sad' ‚Üí The Mirror
  doubt: 'I'm not sure about this decision' ‚Üí The Analyst
  joy: 'This is wonderful news!' ‚Üí The Painter
  creativity: 'I need inspiration for a project' ‚Üí The Dreamer

4. Member Status:
  The Dreamer: Load=0.50, Active=False
  The Analyst: Load=0.50, Active=False
  The Mirror: Load=0.50, Active=False
  The Painter: Load=0.50, Active=False

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Emotional Governance Loop Integration
The council system integrates with the existing emotional governance loop:
- Council members can trigger reflection agent analysis
- Drift detection can route to appropriate council members for intervention
- Mirror Loop provides continuous monitoring for emotional consistency

### 2. AnchorAI Integration
- Council decisions can influence quantization candidate scoring
- Member emotional signatures can be used in anchor weight calculations
- Load balancing considers emotional alignment factors

## Usage Examples

### Explicit Request Routing:
```python
coordinator = CouncilCoordinator()

# Direct member requests
member = coordinator.process_explicit_request("Ask the Dreamer to create a story about flying")
# ‚Üí Routes to The Dreamer

member = coordinator.process_explicit_request("Have the Analyst examine this data pattern")
# ‚Üí Routes to The Analyst
```

### Emotional Context Routing:
```python
# Route based on emotional state
member = coordinator.route_by_emotion(EmotionalContext.GRIEF, "I'm feeling lost")
# ‚Üí Routes to The Mirror (grief specialist)

member = coordinator.route_by_emotion(EmotionalContext.CREATIVITY, "I need inspiration")
# ‚Üí Routes to The Dreamer (creativity specialist)
```

### Background Task Management:
```python
# Start background dreaming
dream_loop = DreamLoop()
dream_loop.start_background_dreaming(interval_minutes=30)

# Start background reflection
mirror_loop = MirrorLoop()
mirror_loop.start_background_reflection(interval_minutes=60)
```

## Key Benefits
