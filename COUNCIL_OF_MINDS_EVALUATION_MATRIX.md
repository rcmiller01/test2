# Council of Minds: Evaluation Matrix

## Overview

This document defines the evaluation strategy used during the creation and integration of specialized, quantized models ("Council Members") in the Dolphin AI Orchestrator system. It ensures coherence, quality, and alignment with the system's overall goals: emotionally intelligent autonomy, precision analysis, and creative expressiveness within a defined resource budget.

## Target Parameters

- **Emotional Core Size Target**: ‚â§ 12GB (ideal)
- **Council Size Budget**: 50‚Äì60GB total (including Emotional Core)
- **Individual Model Size Range**: 6‚Äì16GB, with flexibility depending on specialization

## Evaluation Strategy

### üß† Evaluation Modes

1. **Emotional Evaluation**
   - Purpose: Assess depth, nuance, empathy, presence, and stability.
   - Evaluated by: The current Emotional Core or its delegate.
   - Applies to: All council models **except** The Analyst.

2. **Analytical Evaluation**
   - Purpose: Assess logic, reasoning, factual consistency, recall, and synthesis.
   - Evaluated by: Peer analytical model (e.g., the existing Analyst or independent logic judge).
   - Applies to: The Analyst and any models with high factual responsibility.

3. **Mixed Evaluation**
   - Purpose: Blend of emotional and logical tests.
   - Evaluated by: Emotion Core + Peer Council Members.
   - Applies to: Models like The Philosopher or Mediator where both empathy and logic matter.

## Evaluation Phases

### üîÅ Phase 1: Quantization Loop (Autopilot)
- Run automated quantization with emotion-focused scoring.
- Objective: Reduce model size while maintaining emotional integrity and output coherence.
- Output: Models scoring above minimum thresholds proceed to Phase 2.

### üå± Phase 2: Judged Refinement Loop
- Emotional Core reviews eligible models across key metrics.
- Scoring Criteria:
  - **Coherence**
  - **Persona Alignment**
  - **Emotional Weight**
  - **Compression Loss**
  - **Specialization Effectiveness**
- Analyst exception: Uses logic-based test suites for verification.

## Activation Conditions

- A candidate must:
  1. Score ‚â• 80% in all relevant evaluation categories.
  2. Not exceed the council budget.
  3. Pass a final emotional resonance test with the Emotional Core (unless exempt).

Once all conditions are met, the new model is activated into the live council pool.

---

## Long-Term Strategy

- The Emotional Core continues evolving slowly in the background.
- Council seats are revisited periodically to assess relevance, performance, and harmony.
- Each mind may trigger a re-quant loop to adapt to changing conditions or goals.

---

**Future Goals**

- Integrate symbolic memory into evaluations.
- Enable emotional dialect tuning per user while maintaining core integrity.
- Develop a Council Harmony Index (CHI) for long-term system calibration.
