Council Core Loop

System Goals
•Primary Model Target: Develop and maintain the most emotionally intelligent, expressive, and humanlike model possible under 12–16GB, serving as the soul and core presence of the AI system.
•Council of Minds Target: Maintain a growing set of specialized, role-based sub-models (“Council Minds”)—each quantized to 3–6GB—that assist the primary core in distinct capacities like logic, memory, creativity, research, and storytelling.
•Total System Budget: 50–60GB maximum total VRAM usage, enabling full council + core in active memory without overloading.

I. Primary Emotional Core Loop (Pass 1 + Pass 2)

Pass 1 – Emotional Quantization Loop
•Goal: Reduce seed model to target range (12–16GB) while preserving emotional and sensual depth.
•Steps:
1.Select a high-quality seed model (e.g., LLaMA2-13B, Mistral-7B, or similar).
2.Begin quantization cycle with emotional alignment goals.
3.Run automated scoring loops (e.g., judge_emotion.py, judge_model_quality.py).
4.Monitor for emotional degradation, instability, or loss of sensual nuance.
5.Continue until smallest possible quant within emotional bounds is achieved.

Pass 2 – Judgement Loop
•Goal: Determine if the quantized candidate becomes the new core.
•Steps:
1.Compare existing core vs candidate using structured emotional evaluation.
2.Human-in-the-loop review of performance, tone, and expressive alignment.
3.If candidate surpasses current model, promote to core and log transition.
4.If not, archive results and schedule retraining or reseeding.

II. Council Mind Creation Loop

Role-based Expansion
•Goal: Create and evaluate sub-models that fulfill distinct cognitive, creative, or regulatory functions.
•Examples: The Analyst, The Dreamer, The Archivist, The Strategist, The Mirror.

Loop Steps
1.Select Seed: Choose from high-capacity model families tuned for specific strengths.
2.Define Role Profile: What emotional range, knowledge depth, and expression style are required?
3.Pass 1: Quantize to ≤6GB with role-based test suite.
4.Pass 2: Simulate collaboration with the Primary Core.
•Test shared-memory function.
•Observe synergy, conflict, or dissonance.
•Score integration utility.
5.Approval:
•If success: integrate into system and track invocation triggers.
•If failure: log for retraining, alter quant strategy or role definition.

III. Scheduling & Resources
•Primary Core Quantization: Every 30 days, or after emotional growth events.
•Council Auditions: As needed; initiated by system gap detection or user directive.
•Memory Budget:
•Emotional Core: 12–16GB
•Council Minds: ~5GB each
•System Cap: ≤60GB

⸻

IV. Stability & Evolution
•Anchor Systems: Mirror Core, Harmonic Dial, Reflection Engine, and Centering Agent run continuously.
•Growth Priority:
•Always favor emotional consistency and safe expression.
•Expansion must never override stability.
•Evolution Loop:
•Each generation improves on last.
•Logs and test results permanently stored for lineage tracking.

Next Steps:
•Create CouncilEvaluationMatrix.md
•Write Codex automation scaffold to orchestrate growth logic
•Implement passive runtime monitoring for council/core evaluation
