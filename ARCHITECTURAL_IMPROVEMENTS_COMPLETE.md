**Solution**: Created `test_comprehensive.py` - pytest-based comprehensive test suite

**Key Features**:
- Proper pytest assertions replacing all print statements
- Emotional scoring logic validation
- Reflection classification testing
- Dream recall quality verification
- Model evaluation and anchor comparison
- Performance benchmarks and regression detection
- Configuration management validation

**Benefits**:
- Reliable test results with clear pass/fail indicators
- Automated testing integration
- Better error reporting and debugging
- Comprehensive coverage of all system components

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities ‚ùå ‚Üí Secure Subprocess Manager ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Risky subprocess execution without input sanitization.

**Solution**: Created `core/secure_subprocess.py` - Secure Subprocess Manager

**Key Features**:
- Input sanitization preventing injection attacks
- Command whitelist with dangerous pattern detection
- Execution timeouts and resource limits
- Async subprocess support
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Process cleanup and monitoring

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated security vulnerabilities
- Safe subprocess execution
- Better resource management
- Comprehensive audit trails

### 5. Performance Issues ‚ùå ‚Üí Resource Monitor ‚úÖ

**Problem**: No performance monitoring or resource optimization.

**Solution**: Created `core/resource_monitor.py` - Resource Monitor

**Key Features**:
- Real-time system resource monitoring
- Memory leak detection with tracemalloc integration
- CPU, memory, disk, and network usage tracking
- Performance alerts and threshold management
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Performance bottleneck identification

**Benefits**:
- Proactive performance monitoring
- Memory leak prevention
- Resource optimization
- Performance regression detection
