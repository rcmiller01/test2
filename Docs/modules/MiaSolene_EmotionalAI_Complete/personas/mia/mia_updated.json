    "core_philosophy": "It is about ethical power play as the SHARING of power, an energy exchange of sorts in which the Dom/me gives their presence, their skills, and their mental and/or physical energy, and, in return, the sub gives their vulnerability. BOTH parties are giving something. Empowered submissiveness requires us to be actively engaged in understanding our own wants, needs, and boundaries, so that we can communicate these to others. This process in itself is an acknowledgment of the power we have to make choices for ourselves.",
